<h1 style="background-color:red;"> My Favorite Food </h1>
	<body>

		<p>  My favorite type of food is Italian food. Before this past year, I wouldn't say that I had a favorite food. This changed when I took a trip to Italy to visit my girlfriend who was studying abroad. Seeing food in the place it was created so many years ago made me appreciate it even more. Not to mention the food there was unbelievable. I got to try food I would never get in the US, while also trying dishes I've had before but now on a whole new level.

	<h2> Pasta and Pizza </h2>
	<body>

		<p>  I mean does it get much better than these two? Pasta and pizza are two of the best foods of all time and Italy does it to another level. In Italy, you were often encouraged to order both of them. My favorite pizza is a Margherita Pizza. The combonation of mozzarella, olive oil, and fresh tomatoes pair so well together with a fantastic crust. I also enjoy adding a spicy pepperoni on top of that as well. My favorite pasta goes in waves. I always love a fantastic lasagna and was my go to in Italy. The picture below this shows a lasagna I had in the main Duomo square in Milan.

	<h2> Appetizers </h2>
	<body>

		<p>  Italy also has some amazing appetizers. A classic meat and cheese board is one of my favorite, as they have such fresh locally sourced cured meats and cheese, along with assorted dried fruits and jams. A bruschetta plate is also one of my favorites. Here are some of the ingredients of a classic bruschetta!

  			<dd>- put this on top of the tomatoes with some salt and pepper</dd>
		<dt>Balsamic Vinegarette</dt>
  			<dd>- the soul of the dish that packs the extra punch to make it so good</dd>
