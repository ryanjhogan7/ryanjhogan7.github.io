<h1 style="background-color:green;"> My Favorite Sports Team </h1>
	<p>  My favorite sports team of all time is the <b>Green Bay Packers</b>! I have loved them ever since my parents put the first <span style= "color: green">green</span> and <span style= "color:yellow;">yellow</span> shirt on. 
	</p>
<h2> But I am from Illinois? </h2>
	<p>  Yes I know. This is weird. I am from Illinois but I am a Packers fan. There is a reason to this. Basically, both of my parents are from Iowa and they raised me as a Packers fan. They became fans because the packers radio was the only football team's radio station that reached either of their farms. Because of this, they only has one choice on which team to follow! Below is a picture from one of the few Packers games that I have been to!

<h2> Ownership </h2>
	<p>  In fact, I am also an owner of the Packers! The Packers are a community owned team, the only team in the big four sports (NHL, MLB, NBA, NFL) to do so. It is a very interesting concept that I would suggest you read more about in this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/sep/30/the-green-bay-packers-where-fans-rather-than-a-billionaire-are-the-owners">article</a> if you are eager to learn more!
